# The Go Programming Language Book exercises

Since I'm a fan of buying books with exercises, tasks or projects I embarked
in doing all the exercises of this [cute language](https://golang.org/) book.

All exercises were written, run and/or tested on a Linux x64 machine, but
besides the cgo chapter (chapter 13), I don't think there's anything too
OS/Arch dependant.

I would be remiss if I didn't link [the book page](https://www.gopl.io/)
